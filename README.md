# AI4D-Predict-the-Global-Spread-of-COVID-19
8th place.... The objective of this challenge is to build an epidemiological model that predicts the spread of COVID-19 throughout the world. The target variable is the cumulative number of deaths caused by COVID-19 in each country by each date.  We have selected the cumulative number of fatalities rather than the number of reported infections as the target variable because the real number of infections is unknown and will perhaps never be known. The number of reported cases is understood to be underestimated and largely biased by the availability of tests, which varies from location to location and country to country.  We encourage participants to engage with the literature available on approaches and considerations when modelling the spread of diseases.  For this competition, we have used the publicly-available data from the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), which is updated on a daily-basis.
